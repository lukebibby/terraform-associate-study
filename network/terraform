Usage: terraform [global options] state mv [options] SOURCE DESTINATION

 This command will move an item matched by the address given to the
 destination address. This command can also move to a destination address
 in a completely different state file.

 This can be used for simple resource renaming, moving items to and from
 a module, moving entire modules, and more. And because this command can also
 move data to a completely new state, it can also be used for refactoring
 one configuration into multiple separately managed Terraform configurations.

 This command will output a backup copy of the state prior to saving any
 changes. The backup cannot be disabled. Due to the destructive nature
 of this command, backups are required.

 If you're moving an item to a different state file, a backup will be created
 for each state file.

Options:

  -dry-run                If set, prints out what would've been moved but doesn't
                          actually move anything.

  -lock=false             Don't hold a state lock during the operation. This is
                          dangerous if others might concurrently run commands
                          against the same workspace.

  -lock-timeout=0s        Duration to retry a state lock.

  -ignore-remote-version  A rare option used for the remote backend only. See
                          the remote backend documentation for more information.

  -state, state-out, and -backup are legacy options supported for the local
  backend only. For more information, see the local backend's documentation.
